I know you're thinking what's with the glasses in the picture. This picture has been in my photo library since the day I began to feel confident wearing glasses. Yea, being totally embarrassed about two lens that enhances your vision is a thing. I didn't like the thought of wearing glasses at all. Being visibly Muslim in a high school that had no other Muslims who looked like me already made me noticeable, so I didn't want to draw out another aspect of myself. The first time I wore it I thought everyone was thinking how funny and dorky I looked. I didn't like everyone noticing the added accessory to my face, so I hid my glasses and started to squint and move closer to the board throughout the majority of my entire high school.  I suffered daily and the consequences of not wearing them made my eyes worse. It took months to muster up all my confidence to put it on throughout class and ignore anyone who took a second look at me.  When I think back of those first years, I laugh at how ridiculous that was, because today, I wear my spectacles with confidence and  realize how first-times for everything are always difficult. It takes time and a lot of practice.
